Maven Project With 
Thymeleaf+html
Configuration Based on "Configuration class"
[Not used spring-servlet.xml+web.xml configuration]


Once we start using spring-servlet.xml, it expects all configuration from XML
but thymeleaf configuration is 
better is via springboot project where configuration which is automatic,
but if we use thymeleaf configuration explicitly in Maven Project (with Spring MVC dependency in pom) 
it may not get compatibility, 
hence manual configuration through class is expected, but then DB configuration cant be dependent on 
XML configuration,because(web.xml)  it is configuring through dispatcherservlet ,
so we cannot do 50-50 configuration in class + xml
therefore
all configurations thymeleaf-template resolver Plus DB configuration done
in Class
WHEN A PURE SPRINGBOOT Project is created 
auto configuration happens for Thymeleaf and db configuration can happen in resources - application.properties.xml
--------------------
TIPS ON MAVEN - THYMELEAF - CONFIGURATION CLASS BASED - MAVEN-ARCHETYPE-WEB 1.4
Maven Project internally created
in JDK 17 did not change it to 1.8
REF POM.xml for dependencies

IN CONFIGURATION CLASS NOTE THE FOLLOWING POINTS
import org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp2.BasicDataSource;
// used as in pers lap top - "fix project setup" if error for the above import 
//Use above import  and  not the below one
//import org.apache.commons.dbcp2.BasicDataSource;

USE the following dependency in pom.xml

<!-- BasicDataSource -->
		<dependency>
		  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
		  <artifactId>commons-dbcp2</artifactId>
		  <version>2.10.0</version>
		</dependency>
